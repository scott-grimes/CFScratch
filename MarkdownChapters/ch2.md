# Chapter 2 - Boolean Arithmetic

In this chapter will will build logic gates that can preform arithmetic operations on numbers. We will use only the gates constructed in Chapter 1 to accomplish this. At the end of this chapter we will have a functioning Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU), which will form the heart of our Central Processing Unit (CPU).

## 2.1 Binary Arithmatic

### Specification A - Adders

### Specification B - ALU
